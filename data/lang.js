        Smrt16.com provides information about the SMRT16 project, which combines smart contracts

        `SMRT16 is a blockchain-based, smart contract-powered affiliate program. It operates autonomously, without intermediaries, and ensures that the contract 
        terms are executed as programmed. Users can earn rewards by promoting and referring new users to the program. SMRT16 operates transparently 
        and securely on the blockchain, providing users with full control over their participation and rewards. It is not a legal entity or investment project.`,

        "SMRT16 is an ERC-20 token running in Polygon. This website is Decentralised App (DApp) of the token sale with multi-level referral program built into the smart contract.",

 SMRT16 implements a decentralized idea that operates exclusively on-chain without external management involvement.

        "thegoal":
        `The project's objective is to get people's attention, which will then be capitalized on for ongoing financial advantage for the project's investors.
        SMRT16 generates its funding from token sales, rewarding participants through marketing bonuses.

        //"The goal of the project is to raise the people's attention which later will be monetized for the long lasting profit again back for investors of the project.",

        "marketingthing":
        "The big thing about SMRT16 is decentralization of marketing which is built in the token sale.",

        "bonuses":
        "The funds from the token sale are instantly paid back to the project participants as marketing bonuses.",

        "howitworks": `
        It works as follows: everyone who has ever bought a SMRT16 token through a DApp or directly using the functions of a smart contract becomes a project partner. 
        It is impossible to buy tokens without specifying a referrer. After the purchase, your wallet address becomes your referral code at the same time. 
        And if you add smrt16.com/ and your wallet address, you get your referral link, for example: smrt16.com/0x5c580f5b34f7f7df64f5336f038c8705014a51ee.

        Thus, you become an agent of the project and now you can invite other people to buy SMRT16 tokens. For you - a four-level referral system, in which up to 93.75% of the transaction value is distributed among users directly involved in the transaction. Instant payment of referral bonuses occurs automatically and is guaranteed by a smart contract code on the blockchain.

        The general rule is that each next level of referral bonus has half the amount of bonuses of the previous level, therefore:

        Referral reward of the 1st level is 50% or 1/2 of the deal.
        Referral reward of the 2nd level is 25% or 1/4 of the transaction.
        Level 3 referral reward is 12.5% or 1/8 of the deal.
        Level 4 referral reward is 6.25% or 1/16 of the transaction.


Partners of the SMTR16 project are highly motivated to engage in marketing - after all, referral bonuses are paid instantly. But let's say a user wants to invest, get a few referrals, and then switch to something else. And what? His referral program is not going anywhere. It will work for a year or two and always make a profit, as long as the smart contract on the blockchain works.
